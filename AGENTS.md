## Working with td

td keeps task context durable across sessions. In a new context, run `td usage --new-session -q` to see current work.

Use your judgment about how much tracking a task needs. For substantive work: `td start <id>`, record progress with `td log`, hand off with `td handoff <id>`, then `td review <id>`.

Closing needs a review. Say who did it (default trusted mode; delegated/strict allow only the first):

- independent session: `td approve <id> --reason "..."`
- a sub-agent: `td approve <id> --reviewed-by "<who>"`
- you: `td approve <id> --self-review --reason "..."`

Prefer a reviewer with its own `TD_CONTEXT_ID`; never name one who did not review.

Run `td usage` or `td <command> --help`.

## Browser Screenshots (Visual Proof)

After UI changes, use Playwright to capture browser screenshots as proof. Write a `.mjs` script to `/tmp/`, run with `node`, view `.png` files with the Read tool (renders images inline). Auth token at `~/.config/perch/auth.token`. Full reference: `/browser-proof` skill.
