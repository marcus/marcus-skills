# Human Writing

Write text that reads as authentically human by avoiding patterns commonly associated with AI-generated content.

## Two Modes

**Writing Mode**: Apply guidelines when generating new content.
**Review Mode**: When asked to review text, identify AI patterns and suggest specific improvements.

## Core Principles

1. **Be specific over generic** - Use concrete details, not vague abstractions
2. **Vary sentence rhythm** - Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones naturally
3. **Take a position** - Make claims, express views, avoid hedge-everything language
4. **Use plain words** - Choose simple vocabulary over impressive-sounding alternatives
5. **Break patterns** - Avoid formulaic structures and predictable three-item lists

## Quick Reference: What to Avoid

### Vocabulary Red Flags

Certain words appear disproportionately in AI text. See [references/vocabulary.md](references/vocabulary.md) for the complete list.

**High-frequency tells**: delve, tapestry, vibrant, crucial, pivotal, enhance, foster, intricate, nuanced, multifaceted, comprehensive, underscore, landscape, realm, holistic

**Hedge words (overused)**: arguably, various, specific, generally, relatively, ultimately, particularly

**Filler intensifiers**: truly, really, very, highly, deeply

### Structural Red Flags

- **Rule of three**: Three parallel items in sequence ("X, Y, and Z" repeatedly)
- **Negative parallelism**: "Not just X, but also Y"
- **Mirror conclusions**: Restating the introduction in the conclusion
- **Topic sentence + elaboration** formula in every paragraph
- **"Challenges and future prospects"** closing pattern

### Formatting Red Flags

- Excessive em dashes (—) for parenthetical asides
- Every heading in Title Case
- Overuse of boldface for emphasis
- Lists with inline headers and colons
- Curly/smart quotes when straight quotes expected

## Review Mode Instructions

When asked to review text for AI patterns:

1. Read [references/ai-patterns.md](references/ai-patterns.md) for detailed detection criteria
2. Identify specific patterns present in the text
3. Quote the problematic passages
4. Provide concrete rewrites, not just suggestions
5. Prioritize changes that have the highest impact

**Output format for reviews**:
```
Pattern: [pattern name]
Found: "[quoted text]"
Issue: [brief explanation]
Rewrite: "[improved version]"
```

## Writing Mode Checklist

Before finalizing any generated text:

- [ ] No words from the high-frequency vocabulary list
- [ ] Varied sentence lengths (not all medium-length)
- [ ] No more than one three-item list per section
- [ ] Specific examples instead of abstract claims
- [ ] At least one short, punchy sentence per paragraph
- [ ] No formulaic opening or closing phrases
